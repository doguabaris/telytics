# This workflow builds and tests all packages in a Node.js monorepo
# and publishes each package under `packages/*/` to the public NPM registry
# when a GitHub release is created.
#
# Requirements:
# - Each subpackage in `packages/*/` must have its own valid package.json
# - The `npm_token` secret must be set in the GitHub repository
#
# For more information: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages
